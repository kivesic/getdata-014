# getdata-014
Repository for the course project for Getting and Cleaning Data course at Coursera

This repo contains the file run_analysis.R that performs the analysis of the dataset for the project.

The file run_analysis. R assumes that the working directory is the unzipped directory of the UCI HAR dataset (i.e., the directory contains "test" and "train" subdirectories).

First, the script loads the datasets for the train and the test phases (variables `x_train` and `x_test`) and merges them (variable `x_merged`).
