Repository for the course project for Getting and Cleaning Data course at Coursera

This repo contains the file run_analysis.R that performs the analysis of the dataset for the project.

The file run_analysis. R assumes that the working directory is the unzipped directory of the UCI HAR dataset (i.e., the directory contains "test" and "train" subdirectories).
